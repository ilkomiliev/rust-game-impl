# rust-game-impl

This is more advanced rust implementation of a simple game. It explores traits and their implementation as well as different ways to obtain an owenership in rust.

It splits the code into different modules ans libraries to show example of the different ways to split code into managable units.

It also uses an external crate to generate random numbers, but more importantly to show how to use external libraries.

It also provides some tests and documentation to be used as starting examples.

Nevertheless, this is still beginner level and a lot of improvements can be done for sure.

To play the game just run 

```
cargo run
```

To execute the tests:

```
cargo test
```

To generate the docs and open them in the standard browser:

```
cargo doc --open
```

Additional exercises could be to implement some kind of event listenening for different events, ie high score statistics, etc.
